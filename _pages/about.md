<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Imaging Science](https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/programs/imaging-science/index.html) at the [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/), working with [Prof. Matthew Lew](https://lewlab.wustl.edu/). My main research interest is developing advanced multi-dimensional single-molecule super-resolution techniques to visualize the biological structure and dynamics at the nanoscale.

Prior to WashU, I received a B.S. in Physics at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/). I was a member of the Poling Class of Physics. During my undergraduate studies, I researched the cytoskeleton structure and deformability of human red blood cells using microfluidics and STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) under the supervision of [Prof. Leiting Pan](http://panltlab.org/). Additionally, I interned at [Prof. Qiong Yang](https://websites.umich.edu/~qiongy/)'s Lab in the [Department of Biophysics](https://lsa.umich.edu/biophysics) at the University of Michigan during the summer of 2019.
